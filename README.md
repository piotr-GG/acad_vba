Repository for VBA code for AutoCAD 2018.

All the macros are put in Module1.bas file since organizing them in different modules would defeat the purpose of VBA. 
The recommended way of running them is to add custom commands via CUI command
in AutoCAD and add a shortcut to a given sub (~method) in Module1.
 
Most of the macros are in general form and can be used in various drawings, yet some of them are highly specialized for specific task.
In some macros strings are replaced with "" or "..." and can be hard coded to provide functionality defined by user. 

Most of the macros are executed in AutoCAD but some of them also use Excel.
